# Invoice App

## Intro

Hello, there! üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I would like to introduce you to my Invoice App created as a solution to the <a href='https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/invoice-app-i7KaLTQjl'>invoice app challenge</a> from Frontend Mentor.

## Overview

For this challenge, I used...

 - React (to build out the site)
 - Typescript
 - CSS (to style it) 
 - localStorage (to save user's data)

## Challenge
Users should be able to:

 - View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
 - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
 - Create, read, update, and delete invoices
 - Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice
 - Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid
 - Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid)
 - Toggle light and dark mode
 - Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (localStorage)
